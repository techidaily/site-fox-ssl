## Signs that Your Phone is being Tracked

Let’s delve into the key signs that someone is tracking your phone and how you can safeguard your device.

### Unexpected Screen Activity

Has your phone ever spontaneously lit up, sans any apparent reason? If your device springs to life while in standby mode without any manual input from you, it’s a potential red flag. This could imply tracking or data harvesting processes running in the background. 

### Unexplained Data and Battery Usage

If you’ve been keeping tabs on your monthly mobile data usage and battery life (who isn’t?), sudden and inexplicable spikes might raise eyebrows. If you can’t attribute these to your latest Netflix binge-watch, you might be dealing with covert spy apps that are quietly using your network to download and transmit collected data.

### The Mysterious Green Dot: Camera and Location Access

Next time you spot a green dot on the top corner of your phone, take a moment. If this dot pops up when you’re not using your camera, it’s time to consider potential malicious activity. The same applies to unexpected GPS or location access, which could appear even when you’re not using related apps.

### Sluggish Phone Performance: Is Your Device Overworked?

Is your device running slower than usual, using more battery power, and heating up? Besides being a nuisance, this could be a tell-tale sign that spy apps are overtaxing your phone’s resources.

### Your Google Account and Device Connections

Begin by checking the devices linked to your Google account. This can help identify if your account is being accessed from an unfamiliar device. If you spot an unknown device or suspicious activity, it’s time to revoke its access.

### The Bitly Trick: A Spy Trap

Here’s a nifty trick using [Bit.ly](https://bit.ly). Send a shortened link with a tempting message to a friend (who knows not to open it). If you see clicks on your Bitly dashboard, it could indicate someone else is snooping on your messages and clicking the link.

### Is Your Device Rooted?

Rooting an Android device offers users the liberty to install unapproved apps, an ideal playground for spyware. If your device has been rooted without your consent, that’s a strong sign of suspicious activities. You can use an app like[Root Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck&hl=en&gl=US) to confirm if your device has been rooted.

### Device Administration: Who’s in Charge?

Device Administration is a safety measure on Android. Though intended to improve your phone’s performance, it can be exploited by malicious actors to track or record data. It’s prudent to check and [remove hidden device administrators](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) on your Android device.

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.
