## How will this Feature help you?

Well, if you are like me who has almost half a dozen of extensions in the Chrome, then it is going to help you a lot. When you open a new website, all these extensions starts working on that websites; they consume RAM and Processor to do the desired job. When you open a few more tabs, you will feel it. Your PC becomes sluggish and unresponsive. Now you can enable a particular extension when you want it to do the job. It will not consume the resources on the websites that you don’t want the extension to run.
