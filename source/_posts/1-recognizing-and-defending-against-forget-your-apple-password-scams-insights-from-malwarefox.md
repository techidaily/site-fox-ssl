## What is iforgot.apple Email Scam?

The “iforgot.apple” email scam is a phishing attempt that sends fake emails that look like they came from Apple, to try to get Apple users to give away their login information. The emails usually say that the user’s Apple ID has been locked or disabled and ask them to click on a link to verify their account information.

The email has nothing to do with Apple**®** official company.

Cyber criminals send out bulk emails disguised as Apple ID Support making false claims about the account status. It could say that the Password has been reset, or Account has been blocked, or Logged in from another device/region, or requires verification.

The sole motive of the sender is to get the recipient to click the link/button in the email. This click then could lead to phishing page, malicious download, or something unwanted.

## How iforgot.apple Scam Works?

Scammers send out emails claiming that the user’s account need urgent attention. The reason behind it could be one of the following:

* Account logged in Different Browser / Region / Device
* Account is Blocked / Limited / Restricted for Security reasons
* Account needs a change of Password or re-verification

To fix the problem, users are instructed to use their Apple IDs and passwords to sign in to their Apple accounts through a fake website.

When the user clicks on the link, they are taken to a fake website that looks like Apple’s login page. The user is then asked for their Apple ID and password, which the scammers then use to steal their information. 

If they are successful, cybercriminals will be able to use these accounts to get into the App Store (to buy things), iMessage (to manage messages), iCloud (to access files stored there), and so on.
