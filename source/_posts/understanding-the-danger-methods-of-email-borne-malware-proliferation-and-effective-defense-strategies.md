## What is an Email Virus?

Emails are one of the primary mediums used by cybercriminals to conduct malicious activities. The malicious codes, apps, files, etc. that are spread through emails are known as Email Viruses. Most email viruses get activated when victims click the links, download & open the attachments, or interact with the email in other ways. After infiltrating the system and getting activated, an email virus can quickly replicate itself and spread. 

Generally, email viruses are sent for extracting the user’s private information, such as bank credentials, social media logins, social security numbers, and other security info. Users are prompted to spread such emails, so if you receive any mail asking you to send this to more people, it might be a chain of email virus scams. A craftily framed email virus is quite hard to detect as it is created explicitly by professional attackers.

## How to prevent Email Viruses?

In order to keep your system secure and protect your privacy, it is essential to recognize and prevent email viruses from spreading into your device. 

* Keep installed a robust security solution on your system. It would not only protect your device from malicious attachments but also safeguard your device from every other threat. Keep the security program updated.
* Never open an email attachment sent from unknown and suspicious senders. Usually the files with these extensions are malicious: .**dll, .exe, .com, .pif, .js, .scr, .dot, .xls, .xlt.**
* If you receive an email with links, refrain from clicking on them and navigating to unsolicited websites.
* Get spam filters for your email accounts. Although many email service providers give the in-built feature for filtering out spam emails, you can still get third-party spam filters for extra security.
* Don’t provide your email address to unknown or insecure websites, especially those without an SSL certificate.
* Keep your operating system, applications, and everything else updated with the latest version. An outdated OS or mail application might not detect the latest threats.
* When you receive an email with a catchy subject line or too good to be true offers, thoroughly verify its authenticity before following its instructions.
